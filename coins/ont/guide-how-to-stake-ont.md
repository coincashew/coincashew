# Guide: How to stake ONT

## :checkered_flag:1. Prerequisites

In order to stake, ONT must be stored on a local wallet, where you control the seed/private keys. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember, it's best practice to always withdraw coins from an Exchange.

## :last_quarter_moon_with_face: 2. Download and use a compatible wallet

[o3-neo-ont.md](../../wallets/desktop-wallets/o3-neo-ont.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../wallets/mobile-wallets/exodus-multi-chain-assets.md" %}
[exodus-multi-chain-assets.md](../../wallets/mobile-wallets/exodus-multi-chain-assets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## :fire: 3. Stake your ONT

{% hint style="info" %}
Staking ONT means generating ONG. It's easy to stake because holding ONT in your own wallet is the only requirement.
{% endhint %}

1. Open ONT wallet
2. Copy your ONT address
3. Send or withdraw ONT from exchange or other wallet to your ONT address

{% hint style="info" %}
**Did you know?** ONT and NEO addresses are interchangeable.
{% endhint %}
