# Guide: How to stake XTZ

## :checkered\_flag:1. Prerequisites

* Tez stored on a local wallet. You control the seed/private keys.&#x20;
* Any amount of tez will work, but check if your baker has a minimum delegation amount requirement. For example, some bakers require at least 10 tez to be delegated.

## :last\_quarter\_moon\_with\_face: 2. Download and use a compatible wallet

## :confetti\_ball: 4. Delegate your stake

{% hint style="info" %}
Galleon wallet will be the quickest way to stake and it's safe because your coins never leave your wallet.
{% endhint %}

For this example, we will use **Galleon wallet** and delegate with a **Ledger Nano S**.

1. **Plug** in Ledger Nano S to a USB port, **type** the PIN code, **open** the Tezos Wallet app.
2. **Open** Galleon wallet.

Your **baker's public address** will look something like this.

Copy and paste it. Do not type.
{% endhint %}

8\. Click **Change Delegate** button

9\. **Confirm** the transaction on your Ledger

10\. :tada: Congratulations. Your first rewards should start arrive in about 36 days and then every 3 days after. You will be able to see your rewards on the **Transactions tab**.
