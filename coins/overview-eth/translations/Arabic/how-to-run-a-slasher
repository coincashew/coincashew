# How to run a slasher

## ⏩ Quick steps guide

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps align with our [mainnet guide](./). You may need to adjust file names and directory locations where appropriate. The core concepts remain the same.
{% endhint %}

### 🗡 What is a Slasher?

* Validators might commit slashable transactions such as
  * **Double Voting**: signs more than one block in same epoch
  * **Surround Votes**: signs two contradictory attestations
* A slasher will submit proof of the above offenses into a block proposal.
* Running a slashing helps protect and keeps the network healthy.
* If your slasher successfully detects an offense and is lucky enough to include proof of the offense into your scheduled block proposal, your validator earns extra ETH.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Slashers tend to be resource intensive and is currently recommended for advanced users only.
{% endhint %}

### 🤖 Minimum Slasher System Requirements

* Quad-core or more CPU
* 16+ GB RAM
* 256GB+ SSD HD

### 🚧 How to Configure the Slasher

Slasher functionality is currently available in Lighthouse or Prysm.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Lighthouse " %}
```bash
# Edit your beacon-chain unit file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service

# Append the following slasher flag to ExecStart
--slasher --debug-level debug

# Example of what your ExecStart should look like.
# lighthouse bn --staking --metrics --network mainnet --slasher --debug-level debug

# Reload the new unit file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Restart your beacon-chain
sudo systemctl restart beacon-chain
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Prysm" %}
```bash
# Create a new slasher unit file
cat > $HOME/slasher.service << EOF 
# The eth2 slasher service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/slasher.service 

[Unit]
Description     = eth2 slasher service
Wants           = network-online.target
After           = network-online.target 

[Service]
User            = $(whoami)
ExecStart       = $(echo $HOME)/prysm/prysm.sh slasher --mainnet
Restart         = on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy    = multi-user.target
EOF

# Move the unit file to /etc/systemd/system 
sudo mv $HOME/slasher.service /etc/systemd/system/slasher.service

# Update file permissions.
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/slasher.service

# Enable auto-start at boot time and then start your slasher service.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable slasher
sudo systemctl start slasher
```
