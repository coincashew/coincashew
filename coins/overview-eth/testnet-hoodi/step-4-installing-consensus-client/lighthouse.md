### 1. Initial configuration

Create a service user for the consensus service, create data directory and assign ownership.

```bash
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --group consensus
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lighthouse
sudo chown -R consensus:consensus /var/lib/lighthouse
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install curl ccze jq -y
```

### 2. Install Binaries

* Downloading binaries is often faster and more convenient.
* Building from source code can offer better compatibility and is more aligned with the spirit of FOSS (free open source software).

<details>

<summary>Option 1 - Download binaries</summary>

Run the following to automatically download the latest linux release, un-tar and cleanup.

```bash
RELEASE_URL="https://api.github.com/repos/sigp/lighthouse/releases/latest"
BINARIES_URL="$(curl -s $RELEASE_URL | jq -r ".assets[] | select(.name) | .browser_download_url" | grep x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz$)"

echo Downloading URL: $BINARIES_URL

cd $HOME
# Download
wget -O lighthouse.tar.gz $BINARIES_URL
# Untar
tar -xzvf lighthouse.tar.gz -C $HOME
# Cleanup
rm lighthouse.tar.gz
```

Install the binaries.

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>sudo mv $HOME/lighthouse /usr/local/bin/lighthouse
</strong></code></pre>

<summary>Option 2 - Build from source code</summary>

**Install rust dependency**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

When prompted, enter '1' to proceed with the default install.

Update your environment variables.

```bash
echo export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install rust dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y git gcc g++ make cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev clang protobuf-compiler
```

Build the binaries.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone -b stable https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse.git
cd lighthouse
make
```

In case of compilation errors, run the following sequence.

```bash
rustup update
cargo clean
make
```

Verify lighthouse was built properly by checking the version number.

```
lighthouse --version
```

Install the binary.

```bash
sudo cp $HOME/.cargo/bin/lighthouse /usr/local/bin/lighthouse
```

</details>

### **3. Setup and configure systemd**

Create a **systemd unit file** to define your `consensus.service` configuration.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/consensus.service
```

Paste the following configuration into the file.

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Consensus Layer Client service for Hoodi
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
Documentation=https://www.coincashew.com

[Service]
Type=simple
User=consensus
Group=consensus
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
KillSignal=SIGINT
TimeoutStopSec=900
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lighthouse bn \
  --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse \
  --network hoodi \
  --staking \
  --validator-monitor-auto \
  --metrics \
  --checkpoint-sync-url=https://holesky.beaconstate.ethstaker.cc \
  --port 9000 \
  --quic-port 9001 \
  --http-port 5052 \
  --target-peers 100 \
  --metrics-port 8008 \
  --execution-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8551 \
  --execution-jwt /secrets/jwtsecret

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To exit and save, press `Ctrl` + `X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

Run the following to enable auto-start at boot time.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable consensus
```

Finally, start your consensus layer client and check it's status.

```bash
sudo systemctl start consensus
sudo systemctl status consensus
```

Press `Ctrl` + `C` to exit the status.

Check your logs to confirm that the consensus client is up and syncing.

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu consensus | ccze
```

Press `Ctrl` + `C` to exit the logs.

**Example of Synced Lighthouse Consensus Client Logs**

```bash
Feb 03 01:02:36.000 INFO New block received                      root: 0xb5ccb2f85d981ca9e1c0d904f967403ddf8c47532c195fe213c94a28ffaf6a2e, slot: 2138
Feb 03 01:02:42.000 INFO Synced                                  slot: 2138, block: 0x1cb281a, epoch: 121, finalized_epoch: 120, finalized_root: 0x1dce0, exec_hash: 0x6827aeb (verified), peers: 50, service: slot_notifier
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Stop" %}
```bash
sudo systemctl stop consensus
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Start" %}
```bash
sudo systemctl start consensus
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="View Status" %}
```bash
sudo systemctl status consensus
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Reset Database" %}
Common reasons to reset the database can include:

* To reduce disk space usage
* To recover from a corrupted database due to power outage or hardware failure
* To upgrade to a new storage format

```bash
sudo systemctl stop consensus
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lighthouse/beacon
sudo systemctl restart consensus
```

With checkpoint sync enabled, time to re-sync the consensus client should take only a minute or two.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Now that your consensus client is configured and started, you have a full node.

Proceed to the next step on setting up your validator client, which turns a full node into a staking node.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you wanted to setup a full node, not a staking node, stop here! Congrats on running your own full node! :tada:
