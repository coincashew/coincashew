:fire: **Critical Crypto Reminder:** **Keep your mnemonics, keep your ETH.**



* **Withdrawal Wallet Seed Phrase**: Ideally this is secured by a hardware wallet. Most important piece of data and represents your ETH!
* **Validator Key Mnemonic**: Write this down **offline**. Not email. Not cloud.
* **Validator\_keys directory**: Contains keystore files and deposit\_data.
* **Password for keystore files:** Required when installing validators.



**Suggestions**:

* Create multiple copies. _Best stored in a_ [_metal seed._](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/)
* Make **offline backups**, such as to a USB key, of your **`validator_keys`** directory.
