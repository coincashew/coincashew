<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/EthPillar.final.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## :arrow\_forward: Quickstart: Ubuntu One-liner Install

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coincashew/EthPillar/main/install.sh)"
```

## :new: What is EthPillar?

:smile: **Friendly Node Installer**: Helps you deploy a systemd installation with minority clients Nimbus-Nethermind or Teku-Besu stack in just minutes. MEVboost included.

:floppy\_disk: **Ease of use**: No more remembering CLI commands required. Access common node operations via a simple text user interface (TUI).

:owl: **Fast Updates**: Quickly find and download the latest consensus/execution release. Less downtime!

:tada:**Compatibility**: Behind the scenes, node commands and file structure are identical to V2 staking setups.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Already a running a Validator? EthPillar is compatible with [a Coincashew V2 Staking Setup.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## :fire: Features

:chains: **Ephemery Testnet Support**: Quickest and easiest way run a node now with native Besu-Teku and ethstaker-deposit-cli integrations.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats on installing a EthPillar, making nodes and home staking easier!

<details>

<summary>All types of node operators: Solo staking, Full node, CSM Staking Node</summary>

**Step 1: Configure your network, port forwarding and firewall.**&#x20;

* With EthPillar, configuration can be changed at:
  * **Tools > UFW Firewall > Enable firewall with default settings**
  * Port forwarding is [manually configured](guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/step-2-configuring-node.md#configure-port-forwarding), depending on your router.
  * Confirm port forwarding is working with **Tools** > **Port Checker**
* Alternatively configure manually per the manual guide. [Click here for detailed network configuration.](guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/step-2-configuring-node.md#network-configuration)

**Step 2: Configure your BIOS to auto power on after power loss**

Actual steps vary depending on your computer's BIOS. General idea here: [https://www.wintips.org/setup-computer-to-auto-power-on-after-power-outage/](https://www.wintips.org/setup-computer-to-auto-power-on-after-power-outage/)

**Step 3: Enable Monitoring and Alerts (Optional)**

Found under:

* **Tools** > **Monitoring**

**Step 4: Benchmark your node (Optional)**

Ensure your node has sufficient CPU/disk/network performance.

* **Tools** > **Yet-Another-Bench-Script**

</details>

<details>

<summary>Lido CSM Staking Node Operators</summary>

**Step 1: Generate Validator Keys:**

* Generate new CSM validator keys for the Lido withdrawal vault
* `Ethpillar > Validator Client > Generate / Import Validator Keys`

**Step 2: Upload JSON Deposit Data:**

* Upload the newly generated deposit data file for your CSM keystores to the Lido CSM Widget. [CSM Holesky](https://csm.testnet.fi/?ref=ethpillar) or [CSM Mainnet](https://csm.lido.fi/?ref=ethpillar)
* Provide the required bond amount in ETH/stETH/wstETH.

**Step 3: Monitor Validator Key Deposit:**

* Wait for your CSM validator keys to be deposited by Lido.&#x20;
* Ensure your node remains online during the process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Additional steps for Solo Stakers</summary>

**Step 1: Setup Validator Keys**

* Familarize yourself with the main guide's section on [setting up your validator keys.](guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/step-5-installing-validator/setting-up-validator-keys.md)
* When ready to generate your keys, go to **EthPillar > Validator Client > Generate / Import Validator Keys**

**Step 2: Upload deposit\_data.json to Launchpad**

* To begin staking on Ethereum as a validator, you need to submit to the Launchpad your  deposit\_data.json file, which includes crucial withdrawal address details, and pay the required deposit of 32ETH per validator.

**Step 3: Congrats!**&#x20;

* Now you're waiting in the Entry Queue [https://www.validatorqueue.com](https://www.validatorqueue.com/)

<!---->

* Check out the [next steps from the main guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/step-5-installing-validator/next-steps) for further knowledge. Especially the FAQ's "Wen staking rewards?"

</details>

## :question: FAQ

<details>

<summary>Change Networks: How to switch between testnet and mainnet with EthPillar ?</summary>

To switch to mainnet, there are two recommended methods.

* **Cleanest and most problem-free option**: Reformat Ubuntu OS and re-install EthPillar.&#x20;

<!---->

* **Use EthPillar:** Navigate to **System Administration > Change Network**

</details>

<details>

<summary>Exit Validator: How do I exit a validator?</summary>

If you already have VEMs created, skip to step 2.

Step 1: Navigate to EthPillar > Validator > Generate Voluntary Exit Message

Step 2: Broadcast Voluntary Exit Message

</details>

<details>

<summary>Add Validators: I already have validators running. I want to add one more validator. How do I do that?</summary>

Navigate to,

**EthPillar > Validator Client > Generate / Import Validator Keys**

From there you will pick 1 of 2 options.

* Import validator keys from offline key generation or backup
* Add new or regenerate existing validator keys from Secret Recovery Phrase

</details>

<details>

<summary>Node Types: What is a failover staking node?</summary>

**Purpose**: To provide high availability, you would run TWO (or more) failover staking nodes on separate machines. Point your validator client to your two failover staking nodes.

**What**: A failover staking node is made up of an execution client, consensus client and mevboost.

**How to**: To configure for nimbus validator client, edit your validator client configuration. [https://nimbus.guide/validator-client-options.html#multiple-beacon-nodes](https://nimbus.guide/validator-client-options.html#multiple-beacon-nodes)

Exposing the consensus client RPC port will also be required. You will need to adjust your firewall to allow traffic from your validator client's IP address as well.

**Benefit**: Running multiple failover staking nodes (or beacon nodes as nimbus refers to it) would allow you to perform maintenance or have an outage on 1 failover staking node.
