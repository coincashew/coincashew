# Guide: How to stake on ETH2 Medalla Testnet with Nimbus on Ubuntu

{% hint style="success" %}
[Nimbus](https://our.status.im/tag/nimbus/) is a research project and a client implementation for Ethereum 2.0 designed to perform well on embedded systems and personal mobile devices, including older smartphones with resource-restricted hardware. The Nimbus team are from [Status](https://status.im/about/) the company best known for [their messaging app/wallet/Web3 browser](https://status.im/) by the same name. Nimbus \(Apache 2\) is written in Nim, a language with Python-like syntax that compiles to C.

* **Processor:** Dual core CPU
* **Memory:** 4GB RAM
* **Storage:** 20GB SSD
* **Internet:** 24/7 broadband internet connection with speeds at least 1 Mbps.
* **Power:** 24/7 electrical power
* **ETH balance:** at least 32 Goerli ETH
* **Wallet**: Metamask installed

### 🏋♀ Recommended Futureproof Hardware Setup

* **Wallet**: Metamask installed

If you need to install Ubuntu, refer to

{% page-ref page="../overview-xtz/guide-how-to-setup-a-baker/install-ubuntu.md" %}

If you need to install Metamask, refer to

{% page-ref page="../../wallets/browser-wallets/metamask-ethereum.md" %}

## 🤖 1. Install a ETH1 node

Your choice of either **OpenEthereum** or **Geth**.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OpenEthereum \(Parity\)" %}
####  🤖 Install and run OpenEthereum by execute the following.

```text
mkdir ~/openethereum
cd ~/openethereum
wget https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/releases/download/v3.0.1/openethereum-linux-v3.0.1.zip
unzip openethereum*.zip
chmod +x openethereum
```

#### ⛓ Start the node on goerli chain

```text
./openethereum --chain goerli
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Geth" %}
#### 🧬 Install from the repository.

```text
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install ethereum -y
```

#### 📄 Create a geth startup script

```bash
cat > startGethNode.sh << EOF 
geth --goerli --datadir="$HOME/Goerli" --rpc
EOF
```

#### 🐣 Start the geth node for ETH Goerli testnet

```text
chmod +x startGethNode.sh
./startGethNode.sh
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Syncing the node could take up to 1 hour.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You are fully sync'd when you see the message: `Imported new chain segment`
{% endhint %}

## ⚙ 2. Obtain Goerli test network ETH

Join the [Prysmatic Labs Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YMVYzv6) and send a request for ETH in the **`-request-goerli-eth channel`**

```text
!send <your metamask goerli network ETH address>
```

Otherwise, visit the 🚰 [Goerli Authenticated Faucet](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog).

## 👩💻3. Signup to be a validator at the Launchpad

1. Install dependencies, the ethereum foundation deposit tool and generate keys.

```text
sudo apt install python3-pip git -y
```

```text
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli.git
cd eth2.0-deposit-cli
sudo ./deposit.sh install
```

```text
./deposit.sh --chain medalla
```

2. Follow the prompts and pick a password. Write down your mnemonic and keep this safe, preferably **offline**.

3. Follow the steps at [https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/) but skip the steps you already just completed. Study the eth2 phase 0 overview material. Understanding eth2 is the key to success!

4. Back on the launchpad website, upload the `deposit_data.json` found in the `validator_keys` directory.

5. Connect your metamask wallet, review and accept terms.

6. Confirm the transaction.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be sure to safely save your mnemonic seed offline.
{% endhint %}

## 💡 4. Build Nimbus from source

Install dependencies

```text
sudo apt-get install build-essential git libpcre3-dev
```

Install and build Nimbus.

```text
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain
cd nim-beacon-chain
git checkout devel
make beacon_node
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The build process may take a few minutes.
{% endhint %}

## 🎩 5. Import your validator keys.

```bash
cd $HOME/git/nim-beacon-chain
./build/beacon_node deposits import  --data-dir=build/data/shared_medalla_0 $HOME/git/eth2.0-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```

Enter your password to import your accounts.

## 🏂6. Start the beacon chain and validator

{% hint style="info" %}
**Validator client** - Responsible for producing new blocks and attestations in the beacon chain and shard chains.

**Beacon chain client** - Responsible for managing the state of the beacon chain, validator shuffling, and more.
{% endhint %}

```bash
make \
  BASE_PORT=19000 \
  NODE_PARAMS="--graffiti=poap-goes-here" \
  medalla
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING**: DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL KEYSTORES TO VALIDATE WITH ANOTHER CLIENT, OR YOU WILL GET SLASHED.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations. Once your beacon-chain is sync'd, validator up and running, you just wait for activation. This process takes up to 8 hours. When you're assigned, your validator will begin creating and voting on blocks while earning ETH staking rewards.

Use [beaconcha.in](https://medalla.beaconcha.in/) and [register an account](https://medalla.beaconcha.in/register) to create alerts and track your validator's performance.
{% endhint %}

## 🔥 7. Configure port forwarding and/or firewall

Specific to your networking setup or cloud provider settings, ensure your beacon node's ports are open and reachable. Use [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org/) to verify.

* **Nimbus beacon chain node** will use port 19000 for tcp and udp
* **geth** node will use port 30303 for tcp and udp

## 🕒 8. Time Synchronization

{% hint style="info" %}
Because beacon chain relies on accurate times to perform attestations and produce blocks, your computer's time must be accurate to real NTP or NTS time within 0.5 seconds.
{% endhint %}

Setup **Chrony** with the following guide.

{% page-ref page="../overview-ada/guide-how-to-build-a-haskell-stakepool-node/how-to-setup-chrony.md" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
chrony is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol and helps to keep your computer's time synchronized with NTP.
{% endhint %}
