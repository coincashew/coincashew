# Step 4: Installing consensus client

Your choice of either Lighthouse, Lodestar, Teku, Nimbus, or Prysm.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only one consensus client is required per node.

## **Consensus Client Diversity**

* To strengthen Ethereum's resilience against potential attacks or consensus bugs, it's best practice to run a minority client in order to increase client diversity.

:shield: **Recommendation** :shield:: Teku, Nimbus, or Lodestar
{% endhint %}

### Lighthouse

* Lighthouse: Open-source Ethereum 2.0 project by Sigma Prime, following Ethereum Foundation Research specification.
* Innovative features: Implements advanced blockchain technologies like proof-of-stake consensus, parallel transaction execution, and sharding (state separation).
* Independently managed: Not officially affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation, adheres to their guidance as long beneficial for Ethereum protocol and community.
* Implemented in Rust: Prioritizes security and efficiency through language choice.

### Lodestar

* Lodestar: Open-source Ethereum consensus client by ChainSafe Systems, known for production-ready beacon chain and validator client.
* Flagship product: Ideal for researchers and developers due to rapid prototyping and browser usage capabilities.
* Typescript implementation: Distinctive feature, aligns with familiarity of millions of developers worldwide.
* Light client expertise: Pioneering research, standardization, and implementation of Ethereum light clients.
* Collaborative approach: Works with other implementers, researchers, and developers to promote trustless data usage from the blockchain.

### Teku

* Teku (formerly Artemis): Enterprise-focused Ethereum consensus client developed by PegaSys, an ConsenSys division.
* Apache 2.0 licensed: Open-source with flexible usage permissions.
* Written in Java: Mature and widely used programming language for increased institutional appeal and security requirements.
* Developed by PegaSys: An arm of ConsenSys dedicated to creating enterprise-ready Ethereum clients and tools.

### Nimbus

* Nimbus: Open-source Ethereum client compatible with both Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum 1.0.
* Lightweight resource usage: Designed for optimal performance on embedded systems and resource-restricted devices.
* Versatile application: Also suitable for running alongside other workloads, beneficial for stakers looking to minimize server costs.
* Implemented in Nim: Written using the Nim programming language.
* Maintained by Status.im team.

### Prysm

* Prysm: Full-featured Ethereum 2.0 implementation in Go programming language.
* Developed by Prysmatic Labs.
* Adheres to official Ethereum 2.0 specification, evolving collectively through research and development efforts from various Ethereum ecosystem teams including the Ethereum Foundation.

## Comparison of Consensus Clients

<table><thead><tr><th>Client</th><th width="108">CPU Use</th><th width="111">RAM Use</th><th>Database Size</th><th>Time to sync head</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Lighthouse</strong></td><td>Medium</td><td>6 GB</td><td>120 - 150 GB</td><td>Instant via checkpoint</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lodestar</strong></td><td>Medium</td><td>8 GB</td><td>120 - 150 GB</td><td>Instant via checkpoint</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Teku</strong></td><td>Medium</td><td>10 GB</td><td>120 - 150 GB</td><td>Instant via checkpoint</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nimbus</strong></td><td>Low</td><td>3 GB</td><td>120 - 150 GB</td><td>Instant via checkpoint</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Prysm</strong></td><td>Medium</td><td>6 GB</td><td>120 - 150 GB</td><td>Instant via checkpoint</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Notes:

* As databases expand beyond 300GB in size over time, checkpoint sync allows nodes to efficiently resynchronize and significantly reduce their database sizes while minimizing downtime.
