# Verifying Your Mnemonic Phrase

Ensure you can regenerate the same eth2 key pairs by restoring your `validator_keys`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Offline Key Verifying Best Practices**: The mnemonic seed (24 words) to your validator should be protected by keeping them offline.

If this is not possible, at least physically disconnect from the network by unplugging ethernet cable or disconnecting from Wifi.
{% endhint %}

Using the pre-built staking-deposit-cli executable,

```bash
cd $HOME/ethstaker_deposit-cli
./deposit existing-mnemonic --chain mainnet
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When the **pubkey** in both **keystore** files are **identical**, this means your mnemonic phrase is veritably correct. Other fields will be different because of salting.
{% endhint %}
