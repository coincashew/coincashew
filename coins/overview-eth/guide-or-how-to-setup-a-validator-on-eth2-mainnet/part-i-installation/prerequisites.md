# Step 1: Prerequisites

## :rocket: How Staking on Ethereum Works

1. Acquire some hardware (laptop, desktop, server) or rent a VPS (cloud server): You need to run a node to stake.
2. Sync an execution layer client
3. Sync a consensus layer client
4. Generate your validator keys and import them into your validator client
5. Monitor and maintain your node

A Ethereum node consists of the Execution Layer + Consensus Layer.

A Ethereum Staking node is the previous plus a Validator client.

## :wave: Introduction

This guide was written for aspiring Ethereum stakers who have basic familiarity with command line tools and it was tested against Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS client. You’ll want a dedicated cloud VPS or local desktop/server/laptop running a clean install of Ubuntu preferably.

### Terminology

Your Ethereum staking node may be

* **Local:** on a laptop / PC / NUC that you can physically connect keyboard/mouse/monitor.
* **Remote:** in the cloud on a VPS

If your staking node is **remote**, then you will want to setup SSH, secure shell.

If using a VPS or **remote** node, install and start the SSH client for your operating system:

**Windows**: [PuTTY](https://www.puttygen.com/download-putty)

**MacOS and Linux**: from the Terminal, use the native command:

```
ssh <YourUserName>@<YourServersIP>
```

Here's a [guide from Makeuseof](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/beginners-guide-setting-ssh-linux-testing-setup/) to connect by SSH to your **remote node.**

## :hammer\_pick: How to Run Commands

* Commands are to be run in a terminal window or ssh terminal.
* Commands preceded by `sudo` will prompt for your password at first, and periodically afterwards.

## :woman\_technologist: Skills for operating an staking node

As a validator for Ethereum, you will typically have the following abilities:

* operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Ethereum consensus client, execution client and validator continuously
* a long term commitment to maintain your validator 24/7/365
* basic operating system skills

## :man\_technologist: Experience required to be a successful ETH Staker

* have studied [Ethstaker's Staking for Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/wiki/staking\_for\_beginners/)
* have perused the vast tomes of the [EthStaker Knowledge Base](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/)

## :man\_lifting\_weights: Recommended Node Setup Requirements

* **Operating system:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Server or Desktop
* **Processor:** 4 CPU Cores or more
* **Memory:** 32GB RAM
* **Storage:** Mainnet: 4TB NVME (not QLC). Testnet: 300GB
* **Internet:** Stable broadband internet connections with speeds at least 20 Mbps without data limit.
* **Data Plan**: At least 2 TB per month. Ideally, no data cap or unlimited data plan.
* **Power:** Reliable electrical power with a [Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)](https://www.lifewire.com/best-uninterrupted-power-supplies-4142625).
* **ETH balance:** 2.4ETH for [Lido CSM](https://csm.lido.fi/?ref=ethpillar) or at least 32 ETH for solo staking with 1 validator
* **Wallet**: [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) Wallet installed

* [**Yorick's Storage Advice**](https://gist.github.com/yorickdowne/f3a3e79a573bf35767cd002cc977b038): Refer to Yorick's Great and less great SSDs for Ethereum nodes
* [**Top SSD List**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B27\_j9NDPU3cNlj2HKcrfpJKHkOf-Oi1DbuuQva2gT4/edit)**:** Suitable drives are identified as Mid-Range or better.

:sparkles: **Pro Validator Tip**: Highly recommend you begin with a brand new instance of an OS, VM, and/or machine. Avoid headaches by NOT reusing testnet keys, wallets, or databases for your validator.

## :desktop: Local Node vs Remote Node

**Decision**: Do I run my Ethereum staking node locally at home or rent a VPS cloud server remotely? Here's a list of criteria to help you decide.

|       Criteria       | Local Node                                                                                                                                         | Remote Node                                                                                                                                                                 |

## :tools: Setup Ubuntu

With your local or remote node, now you need to install an Operating System. This guide is designed for Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.

* To install **Ubuntu Server or Desktop**, refer to this [guide](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/tutorials/installing-linux).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recommendation**: A headless (no monitor) install of **Ubuntu Server** on a **dedicated** NUC/laptop/desktop/VPS is best for ease of reliability and security. :fire: Do not use this system for email/browsing web/gaming/socials. :fire:
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Tip**: When installing Ubuntu Server, ensure you are selecting “**Use an entire disk**” on the **Guided storage configuration** screen. Next screen will be the **Storage configuration** screen, ensure your settings are using all available disk storage. A [common issue](../part-iii-tips/using-all-available-lvm-disk-space.md) is that Ubuntu server defaults to using only 200GB.
{% endhint %}

## :performing\_arts: Setup Rabby

When the time comes to make your validator's 32ETH deposit(s), you'll need a wallet to transfer funds to the beacon chain deposit contract.

* To install Rabby, visit their [official site.](https://rabby.io/)

## :jigsaw: High Level Validator Node Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of this guide, you will build a staking validator node that hosts three main components in two layers: consensus layer consists of a consensus client, also known as a validator client with a beacon chain client. The execution layer consists of a execution client, formerly a eth1 node.

**Validator client** - Responsible for producing new blocks and attestations in the beacon chain and shard chains.

**Consensus client** - Responsible for managing the state of the beacon chain, validator shuffling, and more.

**Execution client** - Supplies incoming validator deposits from the eth mainnet chain to the beacon chain client.
