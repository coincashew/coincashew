## :confetti_ball: Delegating ADA to a Stake Pool

**To delegate your ADA cryptocurrency to a stake pool:**

1. Install an official wallet for [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) such as [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io) or [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com)  
{% hint style="info" %}
Yoroi is quicker to set up than Daedalus. The following steps explain how to delegate using Yoroi.
