# Prerequisites

After completing the _How to Set Up a Cardano Stake Pool_ guide, you will know how to register and operate a secure stake pool on Mainnet. The guide also includes instructions throughout explaining how to configure a stake pool to operate in a Testnet environment.

Operating a stake pool in a Cardano [Testnet Environment](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/environments) prior to registering a stake pool in the Mainnet production environment offers a risk-free approach to start learning practically about the technical skills, commitment, responsibilities and benefits of operating a Cardano stake pool.

If you are unsure of the Testnet environment to use to practice registering and operating a stake pool, consider using the [Preview](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/environments#preview) testing network environment.

When operating a stake pool on Mainnet, using a Testnet environment to test configuration changes and upgrades as well as troubleshoot any issues that may arise without impacting the production environment is very helpful.

## :man\_mage: Mandatory Skills for Stake Pool Operators

As a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) for Cardano, you need:

* Operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Cardano node continuously
* A commitment to maintain your node 24/7/365
* System operation skills including general knowledge of [Linux](https://linuxjourney.com/), [Bash scripting](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners), [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format](https://attacomsian.com/blog/what-is-json?msclkid=0445ae34ce4d11ec84216d09187b5112), [systemd services](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-create-systemd-service-unit-in-linux) and [cron jobs](https://itsfoss.com/cron-job/)
* Server administration skills (operational and maintenance)
* Fundamental understanding of [networking](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/networking-a-complete-guide)

## :mage: Mandatory Experience for Stake Pool Operators

* Experience of development and operations (DevOps)
* Experience in how to [harden ](https://www.lifewire.com/harden-ubuntu-server-security-4178243)and [secure a server](https://gist.github.com/lokhman/cc716d2e2d373dd696b2d9264c0287a3).
* In the [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/), successfully complete the section [Operate a Stake Pool](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/)

## :unlock: Recommended Stake Pool Security

If you need ideas on how to harden your stake pool's nodes, see the topic [Hardening an Ubuntu Server](hardening-an-ubuntu-server.md).

## :tools: Setup Ubuntu

Refer to the respective guide to [Install Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server) or [Install Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop).

## :bricks: Rebuilding Nodes

If you are rebuilding or reusing an existing Cardano Node installation, see the topic [Resetting an Installation](../part-v-tips/resetting-an-installation.md).
