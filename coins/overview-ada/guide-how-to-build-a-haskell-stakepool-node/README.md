## :tada: Introduction

The _How to Set Up a Cardano Stake Pool_ guide aims to give you complete, step-by-step instructions to implement a secure Cardano stake pool using the currently recommended software versions.

The guide also aims to give you the understanding and skills you need to perform administrative tasks related to managing and maintaining a stake pool successfully over time.

The guide includes the following parts:

* [**Part I - Installation**](part-i-installation/) describes how to secure the Linux computers hosting your Cardano stake pool, as well as how to install Cardano node software and dependent software packages.
* [**Part II - Configuration**](part-ii-configuration/) explains how to set up Cardano nodes to create a stake pool.
* [**Part III - Operation**](part-iii-operation/) discusses how to create your stake pool.
* [**Part IV - Administration & Maintenance**](part-iv-administration/) provides procedures that you need to manage your stake pool.
* [**Part V - Tips**](part-v-tips/) contains additional procedures to simplify managing your stake pool.
