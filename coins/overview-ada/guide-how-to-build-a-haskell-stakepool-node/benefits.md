# :muscle: Benefits of Operating a Cardano Stake Pool

Operating a Cardano stake pool is similar to owning a bank. Stake pools help to secure an ecosystem having the potential to continue growing on a global scale, without limits set by geopolitics.

Operating a stake pool gives you a unique opportunity to grow a resilient community of shared values, no matter where you are, who you are or what you do. When starting a stake pool, you do not need to know everything about how you plan to succeed. You operate the stake pool day to day on your own terms. To operate a stake pool, you do not seek permission. You do not need to explain your reasons for being a stake pool operator. No one can stop you. You only retire if and whenever you want.

Theoretically, the Cardano protocol slightly incentivizes community members who delegate stake to your pool to help grow the pool, for example by continuing to stake returns. Practically, the protocol ensures that every stake in the Cardano ecosystem fairly receives approximately the same rate of return. Your careful hard work, dedication and patience building a better world as well as strengthening the Cardano ecosystem pay off.

By design, the size of every Cardano stake pool is fluid. Regardless of stake size, every stake pool plays an important role in creating a healthy business environment by helping decentralize and offering choice for consumers in the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano's strength lies in diversity.

Operating a stake pool involves an element of delivering customer service. Good customer service is critical to the long-term success of Cardano.

While observing the practices of other stake pools may be a beneficial learning experience, comparing your stake pool to other stake pools is not helpful. As a stake pool operator, you gain unique, individual insight and perspective within the Cardano ecosystem, giving you a valuable and important voice within the community as your experience grows. As your skills and knowledge improve, you become more able to contribute to the Cardano community in ways that interest you. Operating a stake pool allows you to command respect.

Going "all in" on Cardano or any other crypotcurrency project is probably very risky. Understanding your tolerance for risk before investing is very important so you can make suitable and educated investment decisions, including decisions related to investing in operating a stake pool. Make your approach sustainable. For example, diversify your investments. Always follow local laws and regulations.

Securing the network is only the beginning!
