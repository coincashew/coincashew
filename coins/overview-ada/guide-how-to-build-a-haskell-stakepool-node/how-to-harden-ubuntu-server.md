# How to Harden Ubuntu Server

{% hint style="success" %}
Thank you for your support and kind messages! It really energizes us to keep creating the best crypto guides. Use [cointr.ee to find our donation ](https://cointr.ee/coincashew)addresses and share your message. üôè 
{% endhint %}

## ü§ñ Pre-requisites

* Ubuntu Server or Ubuntu Desktop installed
* SSH server installed
* a SSH client or terminal window access

In case you need to install SSH server, refer to:

{% embed url="https://www.simplified.guide/ubuntu/install-ssh-server" %}

In case you need a SSH client for your operating system, refer to:

{% embed url="https://www.howtogeek.com/311287/how-to-connect-to-an-ssh-server-from-windows-macos-or-linux/" %}

## üßô‚ôÇ Create a non-root user with sudo privileges

{% hint style="info" %}
Make a habit of logging to your server using a non-root account. This will prevent the accidental deletion of files if you make a mistake. For instance, the command rm can wipe your entire server if run incorrectly using by a root user.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*\*\*\*üî• **Tip**: Do NOT routinely use the root account. Use `su` or `sudo`, always.
{% endhint %}

SSH to your server

```bash
ssh username@server.public.ip.address
# example
# ssh myUsername@77.22.161.10
```

Create a new user called cardano

```text
useradd -m -s /bin/bash cardano
```

Set the password for cardano user

```text
passwd cardano
```

Add cardano to the sudo group

```text
usermod -aG sudo cardano
```

## \*\*\*\*üîè **Disable SSH password Authentication and Use SSH Keys only**

{% hint style="info" %}
The basic rules of hardening SSH are:

* No password for SSH access \(use private key\)
* Don't allow root to SSH \(the appropriate users should SSH in, then `su` or `sudo`\)
* Use `sudo` for users so commands are logged
* Log unauthorized login attempts \(and consider software to block/ban users who try to access your server too many times, like fail2ban\)
* Lock down SSH to only the ip range your require \(if you feel like it\)
{% endhint %}

Create a new SSH key pair on your local machine. Run this on your local machine. You will be asked to type a file name in which to save the key. This will be your **keyname**.

Your choice of [ED25519 or RSA](https://goteleport.com/blog/comparing-ssh-keys/) public key algorithm.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ED25519" %}
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="RSA" %}
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Transfer the public key to your remote node. Update the **keyname**.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/<keyname>.pub cardano@server.public.ip.address
```

Login with your new cardano user

```text
ssh cardano@server.public.ip.address
```

Disable root login and password based login. Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config file`

```text
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Locate **ChallengeResponseAuthentication** and update to no

```text
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

Locate **PasswordAuthentication** update to no

```text
PasswordAuthentication no 
```

Locate **PermitRootLogin** and update to no

```text
PermitRootLogin no
```

Locate **PermitEmptyPasswords** and update to no

```text
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

**Optional**: Locate **Port** and customize it your **random** port.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use a **random** port \# from 1024 thru 49141. [Check for possible conflicts. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)
{% endhint %}

```bash
Port <port number>
```

Validate the syntax of your new SSH configuration.

```text
sudo sshd -t
```

If no errors with the syntax validation, reload the SSH process

```text
sudo service sshd reload
```

Verify the login still works

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Standard SSH Port 22" %}
```text
ssh cardano@server.public.ip.address
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Custom SSH Port" %}
```bash
ssh cardano@server.public.ip.address -p <custom port number>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively, you might need to use the following: 

Add the `-p <port#>` flag if you used a custom SSH port.

```bash
ssh -i <path to your SSH_key_name> cardano@server.public.ip.address
```
Use the ssh key name without the .pub extension
{% endhint %}

## \*\*\*\*ü§ñ **Update your system**

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's critically important to keep your system up-to-date with the latest patches to prevent intruders from accessing your system.
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

Enable automatic updates so you don't have to manually install them.

```text
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

## üß∏ Disable root account

System admins should not frequently log in as root in order to maintain server security. Instead, you can use sudo execute that require low-level privileges.

```bash
# To disable the root account, simply use the -l option.
sudo passwd -l root
```

```bash
# If for some valid reason you need to re-enable the account, simply use the -u option.
sudo passwd -u root
```

## üõ† Setup Two Factor Authentication for SSH

{% hint style="info" %}
SSH, the secure shell, is often used to access remote Linux systems. Because we often use it to connect with computers containing important data, it‚Äôs recommended to add another security layer. Here comes the two factor authentication \(_2FA_\).
{% endhint %}

```text
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator -y
```

To make SSH use the Google Authenticator PAM module, edit the `/etc/pam.d/sshd` file:

```text
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd 
```

Add the follow line:

```text
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Now you need to restart the `sshd` daemon using:

```text
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` 

```text
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Locate **ChallengeResponseAuthentication** and update to yes

```text
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
```

Locate **UsePAM** and update to yes

```text
UsePAM yes
```

Save the file and exit.

Run the **google-authenticator** command.

```text
google-authenticator
```

It will ask you a series of questions, here is a recommended configuration:

* Make tokens ‚Äútime-base‚Äù": yes
* Update the `.google_authenticator` file: yes
* Disallow multiple uses: yes
* Increase the original generation time limit: no
* Enable rate-limiting: yes

You may have noticed the giant QR code that appeared during the process, underneath are your emergency scratch codes to be used if you don‚Äôt have access to your phone: write them down on paper and keep them in a safe place.

Now, open Google Authenticator on your phone and add your secret key to make two factor authentication work.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note**: If you are enabling 2FA on a remote machine that you access over SSH you need to follow **steps 2 and 3** of [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-ssh-on-ubuntu-18-04) to make 2FA work.
{% endhint %}

## üß© Secure Shared Memory

{% hint style="info" %}
One of the first things you should do is secure the shared [memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) used on the system. If you're unaware, shared memory can be used in an attack against a running service. Because of this, secure that portion of system memory. 

To learn more about secure shared memory, read this [techrepublic.com article](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enable-secure-shared-memory-on-ubuntu-server/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### One exceptional case

There may be a reason for you needing to have that memory space mounted in read/write mode \(such as a specific server application like **Chrome** that requires such access to the shared memory or standard applications like Google Chrome\). In this case, use the following line for the fstab file with instructions below.

```text
none /run/shm tmpfs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
```

The above line will mount the shared memory with read/write access but without permission to execute programs, change the UID of running programs, or to create block or character devices in the namespace. This a net security improvement over default settings.

### Use with caution

With some trial and error, you may discover some applications\(**like Chrome**\) do not work with shared memory in read-only mode. For the highest security and if compatible with your applications, it is a worthwhile endeavor to implement this secure shared memory setting.

Source: [techrepublic.com](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enable-secure-shared-memory-on-ubuntu-server/)
{% endhint %}

Edit `/etc/fstab`

```text
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Insert the following line to the bottom of the file and save/close.

```text
tmpfs	/run/shm	tmpfs	ro,noexec,nosuid	0 0
```

Reboot the node in order for changes to take effect.

```text
sudo reboot
```

## \*\*\*\*‚õì **Install Fail2ban**

{% hint style="info" %}
Fail2ban is an intrusion-prevention system that monitors log files and searches for particular patterns that correspond to a failed login attempt. If a certain number of failed logins are detected from a specific IP address \(within a specified amount of time\), fail2ban blocks access from that IP address.
{% endhint %}

```text
sudo apt-get install fail2ban -y
```

Edit a config file that monitors SSH logins.

```text
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Add the following lines to the bottom of the file.

{% hint style="info" %}
üî• **Whitelisting IP address tip**: The `ignoreip` parameter accepts IP addresses, IP ranges or DNS hosts that you can specify to be allowed to connect. This is where you want to specify your local machine, local IP range or local domain, separated by spaces.

```text
# Exampleignoreip = 192.168.1.0/24 127.0.0.1/8 
```
{% endhint %}

```bash
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = <22 or your random port number>
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
# whitelisted IP addresses
ignoreip = <list of whitelisted IP address, your local daily laptop/pc>
```

Save/close file. 

Restart fail2ban for settings to take effect.

```text
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

## \*\*\*\*üß± **Configure your Firewall**

The standard UFW firewall can be used to control network access to your node.

With any new installation, ufw is disabled by default. Enable it with the following settings.

* Port 22 \(or your random port \#\) TCP for SSH connection
* Port 6000 TCP for p2p traffic
* Port 3000 TCP for Grafana web server \(if hosted on current node\)
* Port 9090 tcp for Prometheus export data \(optional, if hosted on current node\)

```bash
ufw allow <22 or your random port number>/tcp
ufw allow 6000/tcp
ufw allow 3000/tcp
ufw enable
ufw status numbered
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not expose Grafana \(port 3000\) and Prometheus endpoint \(port 9090\) to the public internet as this invites a new attack surface! A secure solution would be to access Grafana through a ssh tunnel with Wireguard.
{% endhint %}

Only open the following ports on nodes behind a network firewall.

\*\*\*\*üî• **It is dangerous to open these ports on a VPS/cloud node.**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp
```

Confirm the settings are in effect. 

> ```csharp
>      To                         Action      From
>      --                         ------      ----
> [ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
> [ 2] 3000/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
> [ 3] 6000/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
> [ 4] 22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
> [ 5] 3000/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
> [ 6] 6000/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
> ```

**\[ Optional but recommended \]** Whitelisting \(or permitting connections from a specific IP\) can be setup via the following command.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <your local daily laptop/pc>
# Example
# sudo ufw allow from 192.168.50.22
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 üéä **Port Forwarding Tip:** You'll need to forward and open ports to your validator. Verify it's working with [https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) or [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org/) .
{% endhint %}

## üî≠ Verify Listening Ports

If you want to maintain a secure server, you should validate the listening network ports every once in a while. This will provide you essential information about your network.

```text
netstat -tulpn
```

```text
ss -tulpn
```
