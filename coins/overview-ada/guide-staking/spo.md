# :globe_with_meridians:Stake Pool Operator

Do some research into the stake pool operator. Are they **asking** questions about how to run a pool, or are they **answering** questions? Do they run many different pools? If so, why so many and why not consolidate pledge for the benefit of delegators? Do they contribute to the overall community or ecosystem in some way? Is the pool run by an individual or a team? Do they completely understand how the protocol and reward model works? Can you reach out to them with questions?

Regarding potential delegation suggestions or advice from SPOs, consider the source of the information. SPOs and delegators form relationships for mutual benefit based on differing financial incentives within the system. As a delegator, you want high rewards from your stake. SPOs may be incentivized to run as many pools as possible at the highest acceptable fee, at the expense of rewards for delegators. If an SPO suggests that you delegate to their pool, evaluate and decide for yourself whether the pool offers a balance of acceptable returns on your stake and usefulness to society as well as the Cardano network and ecosystem that you want to support.

Here are some, but not all, examples of fraudulent pool behaviors to avoid:

- Impersonating other pools or businesses without any affiliation
- Modifying pool parameters just before and after epoch transitions to avoid detection of the modifications

Following up with the SPO for more information may be helpful when deciding whether to delegate to pools:

- Promising higher rewards than the pool can offer
- Offering additional tokens or any other future value in exchange for your rewards
- Supporting charities or not-for-profit organizations
