# :globe_with_meridians:Stake Pool Operator

Do some research into the stake pool operator. Are they **asking** questions about how to run a pool, or are they **answering** questions? Do they run many different pools? If so, why so many and why not consolidate pledge for the benefit of delegators? Do they contribute to the overall community or ecosystem in some way? Is the pool run by an individual or a team? Do they completely understand how the protocol and reward model works? Can you reach out to them with questions?

Be cautious accepting delegation suggestions or advice from any SPO. SPOs and delegators have different financial incentive within the system. As a delegator, you want high rewards from your stake. SPOs want to run as many pools as possible at the highest acceptable fee, at the expense of rewards for delegators. SPOs will suggest that you delegate to their pool. However, their pool may not offer you the highest return on your stake.

Here are some, but not all, examples of fraudulent pool behavior that should be avoided. Pools that:

- Impersonate other pools or businesses without any affiliation
- Promise higher rewards than their pool can offer
- Promise additional tokens or any other future value in exchange for your rewards
- Modify their parameters just before and after epoch transitions to avoid detection
