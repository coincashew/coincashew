  If you plan to delegate ADA, then you need to select a stake pool. The _Staking for Delegators_ guide aims to explain factors involved in making decisions related to selecting a stake pool that prioritize your rewards and the health of the Cardano network.

# :seedling:Guide: Staking for Delegators

## Introduction

Delegation allows holders of ADA to transfer their right to participate in the proof of stake protocol to stake pools. **Stake pool operators (SPOs)** run stake pools. A person delegating to a stake pool is called a **delegator**, **member** or **participant**.

A stake pool consists of a block-producing (BP) node and any number of relay nodes. The blockchain is comprised of consecutive blocks and stake is power to make blocks.

One pool or person gaining too much stake power can:

- Control consensus
- Engage in double-spending attacks
- Create forks
- Censor blocks
- Damage or even destroy the system

Your delegation choice—who you give your power to—is very important at limiting a single entity from creating too many blocks.

There should never be a conflict of interest between maximizing rewards and "doing the right thing." The staking mechanism was designed so that you can optimally secure the network by trying to maximize your rewards and being greedy with your delegation choice. Stake pools can offer very different return rates.

As a delegator, the attractiveness of a pool depends on four interacting elements:

- **Pledge**—The higher, the better
- **Operating Costs** and **Operator Margin**—The lower, the better
- **Performance**—The higher, the better

Consider how these four elements affect your rewards, and evaluate the stake pool operator as well.
