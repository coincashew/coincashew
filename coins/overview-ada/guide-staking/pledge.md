# :bow:Pledge

**Pledge** is the amount of stake that the stake pool operator has invested in their own pool. Pledge represents a commitment to the network.

An operator having very little pledge and controllling a large amount of stake is highly leveraged. The lower the leverage of a blockchain system, the higher the degree of decentralization.

Pledge is part of the mechanism discouraging one person from operating many pools—pool splitting—because pool reward rates increase with pledge. If a stake pool operator wants to split one pool into many, then the operator must dilute their pledge between all the new pools, causing all of the pools to receive lower rewards than if the pledge were consolidated into one pool. Pledge is the only pool parameter that increases rewards and, paired with saturation, aids in decentralizing the network.

One person opening many high-pledged pools is prohibitively expensive. Open person opening many low-pledged pools is relatively inexpensive. The backbone of the Cardano security model is the principal that a single individual gathering a majority of stake by opening many high-rewarding pools is almost impossible due to the cost.

Every 500k ADA pledge increase means that delegators receive ≈ 0.008% annual percentage yield (APY) **more** rewards.
