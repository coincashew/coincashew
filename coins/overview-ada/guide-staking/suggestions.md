# :bulb:Additional Suggestions

Use a notification service such as [PoolToolBot](https://t.me/pooltoolbot) or the [Cardanoscan Bot](https://t.me/cardanoscanbot) to notify you of oversaturation, or any changes to pool parameters such as pledge or fees.

To compare stake pools, using the [Cardano Reward Calculator](https://dynamicstrategies.io/crewardcalculator) by [Dynamic Strategies](https://dynamicstrategies.io/) includes pool parameters in the reward equation to estimate the reward rate more accurately.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Cardano Staking Calculator](https://cardano.org/calculator/) is very inaccurate.
