# :bulb:Additional Suggestions

Use a notification service such as [PoolToolBot](https://t.me/pooltoolbot) or the [Cardanoscan Bot](https://t.me/cardanoscanbot) to notify you of oversaturation, or any changes to pool parameters such as pledge or fees.

When you switch stake pools, the transaction fee is about 0.18 ADA. Try to minimize how often you change stake pools. Transaction fees may diminish your rewards.

You do not need to withdraw staking rewards. Rewards and any new ADA in your wallet are automatically included in your staking balance.

To compare stake pools, using the [Cardano Reward Calculator](https://dynamicstrategies.io/crewardcalculator) by [Dynamic Strategies](https://dynamicstrategies.io/) includes pool parameters in the reward equation to estimate the reward rate more accurately.

The [Cardano Staking Calculator](https://cardano.org/calculator/) is very inaccurate.
